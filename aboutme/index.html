    <h2>Caden Stutz</h2>
    <p>My name is Caden Stutz and I was born and raised in Littleton, Colorado. Being from Colorado,
    I love being active and doing things outdoors. I love fitness and doing martial arts, which are
    both industries I'd like to work in. I am currently in my last semseter here at BYU-Idaho and I
    am majoring in marketing. I currently work as a digital marketer, and I am trying to expand my
    knowledge. I am excited to learn more about web design and understanding the structure of it.
